# Agent Context

**This repo:** `ffreis-platform-vaultctl` — A Go CLI tool.

## Non-obvious facts

- **Test coverage minimum:** `COVERAGE_MIN=90` — enforced locally via
  `make coverage-gate` (pre-push) and in CI via `coverage.yml`.
- **Mutation testing:** Runs monthly against `./internal/...` with a
  `60%` efficacy threshold. Triggered by `mutation.yml`.
- **lefthook hooks** pull from `ffreis-platform-standards` (pinned SHA) and run
  `make quality-gates` on pre-push. Install with `make setup`.
- **Renovate** keeps Go module dependencies and GitHub Actions SHAs updated automatically.
  It extends `ffreis-platform-standards:renovate/go`.
